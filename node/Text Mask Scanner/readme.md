# EyePop.AI Text Scanner Mask

This is a computer vision powered label scanner for detecting alcohol bottel brands and quickly pulling up cocktail recipes based on detected text.
It draws the text as an overlay, just point your camera and snap an image of the bottles. 
This project allows you to select a camera input, draw a mask over the portion of the camera feed you wish to be detected, and easily capture a picture of your feed and send it to EyePop.
